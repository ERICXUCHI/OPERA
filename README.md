This is the official code release for OPERA: OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation models

OPERA is an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (136K samples, 440 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health.
